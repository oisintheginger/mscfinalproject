> [!note] Collaboration and Learning
>  I worked closely with Charlotte and Fenna to get feedback on the documents I was working on. I know sometimes writing isn't my strong suit and I tend to write too much filler sometimes. It was good to get their feedback and help on the presentation/report/survey.
>  As mentioned, I also hopped on call with Sean to help get him set up with RapidAPI. We had some trouble getting him access to the organization API subscription, which we then solved. I also was explaining to him the restrictions we had on the API (request number/rate limits), and gave him guidance on how to approach the problem with Python.

> [!tip] Reflections
> This week was quite anxiety inducing from my end. I felt very overwhelmed and I feel that has impacted on my speed/output this week. 
> When I get anxious, I tend to get very fidgety and end up in research rabbit holes. For example, because I didn't know exactly how the authorization process + cookies would work, I ended up in a 1 hour long rabbit hole researching httpOnly cookies and how they work. This caused me to lose concentration on what I was doing, which took me more time to get back into the swing of.
> I think it will be a challenge for me to manage my anxiousness and not let it impact my work as much. I will need to practice better organization and diligence to keep me on track of what I am supposed to be working on.
