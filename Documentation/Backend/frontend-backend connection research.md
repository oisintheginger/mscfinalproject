How to connect the React/aws amplify frontend to the springboot-aws lambda backend?

- Connect React to Spring Boot:

In your React components, make HTTP requests to the AWS API Gateway endpoint that exposes your Spring Boot application.

    fetch('YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL/endpoint', {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));
NOTE: The React Frontend might have to be deployed 
- Handle CORS:

Your Spring Boot application should be configured to allow cross-origin requests from your React frontend.

        @CrossOrigin(origins = "YOUR_REACT_AMPLIFY_URL")
        @RestController
        public class MyController { ... }

Alternatively, you can configure CORS settings in AWS API Gateway:

1. Navigate to AWS Management Console:

Open the AWS Management Console. Navigate to the API Gateway service.

2. Select Your API:

In the navigation pane, click on APIs. Choose the API you want to enable CORS for from the list.

3. Enable CORS:

In the left sidebar, under your API's name, navigate to the Resources section.
Choose the specific resource (e.g., /myresource), or if you wish to enable CORS for all resources, choose the root (/).
In the Actions menu, click on Enable CORS. A configuration window will pop up.

4. Specify CORS Settings:
You will be presented with a list of settings that you can configure. Fill in these fields according to your requirements. Remember, the more restrictive your settings, the more secure your API will be.
   Some common configurations include:
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: The origins that are allowed to make cross-domain requests. For development purposes, you might see * used, which allows all domains. For production, specify the actual domain (e.g., https://yourfrontend.com).
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Headers that are allowed in the actual request.
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods: HTTP methods that are allowed (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

5. Deploy Your API:
After enabling and configuring CORS, you need to deploy the changes for them to take effect.
In the Actions menu, click Deploy API.
Choose an existing deployment stage or create a new one, then deploy.

6. Verify CORS Configuration:
Once deployed, you can test the CORS configuration. Use your web application or tools like CORS Anywhere or Postman to send requests to your API.
Ensure the browser or tool you're using respects the CORS headers and restrictions.

7. Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any issues, check the browser's console for CORS-related errors.
Ensure that your backend is not overwriting or conflicting with the CORS headers set by API Gateway.
Remember that cookies and authentication require additional setup when working with CORS. If using cookies or authentication tokens, ensure the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header is set to true.

- Secure the Connection (optional but recommended):

Always use HTTPS when deploying your applications.
Consider using AWS Cognito for authentication. With Cognito, you can easily set up user sign-up and sign-in for your React app, and securely call your backend after authentication.
If using Cognito, set up your API Gateway to authorize requests using the Cognito user pool.

- Optimizations:

Consider using AWS parameter store to securely store credentials such as the AWS credentials. 
Consider using a custom domain for your API Gateway to make your endpoints more user-friendly.
Use AWS CloudFront in front of your API Gateway and Amplify site for better performance globally.

Remember to check both the AWS Lambda and API Gateway logs for debugging any issues. Lambda will provide logs about the execution of your Spring Boot app, while API Gateway will provide logs about incoming HTTP requests.
