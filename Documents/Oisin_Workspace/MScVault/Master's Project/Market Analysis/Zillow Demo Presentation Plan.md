## Zillow Demo:
1. Search Baltimore into landing page
2. Give general layout of browsing results page
	1. Map View (zooming in and out acts as radius filter)
	2. List Results
	3. Filter locations
	4. Quick favorite from list results
	5. Property Details Modal:
			- Quite Cramped
			- Not consistent depending on a multiple unit listing or single listing
			- Price History
			- Walkability Rating
			- Schools Rating
			- Legal Protections
			- Contact Details
			- Save + Share
			- Footer at the bottom of the listing
	6. Save Searches
3. Saving searches can be used again
4. Can manage applications from renter hub
5. Recommendations, doesn't work for me on the landing page, but Zillow has been sending me recommendation emails.
## UX Criticisms Summary:
- Nested Modal for applying, bit cluttered and clunky
- Cramped Details Modal, can be very overwhelming
- Inconsistent Schema and contents depending on the type of listing
- Map View is non-toggleable, takes up a huge portion of the screen
