- Damian assessed using 4 different types of disability: Physical (Limited motion i.e. only 1 arm), Visual Impairment/Blindness, Hearing Impairment/Deafness, Cognitive Impairment (Dyslexia)
- Physical Disability: Site has no barriers for people with Physical Disability
- Visual Impairment: 
	- Problem with Forgot Password
	- Filter Titles are Too Small
	- The colors of the tags and the different scores do not match
	- Make transportation score + transport tag match
- Future Work could be in making accessibility tag for users in wheelchairs, so that they may know if a site is wheelchair accessible. ***I think this could be implemented if we had a full control over the DB schema, we could enforce a accessibility certification as part of posting a listing***
- Drag'n'Drop Component works really well and is easy for screen readers
- Future work would implement the weights into the filtering mechanism
- Mention about the delete account button color choice in the final: We chose to only make the delete button red because that is the danger button, if we colored the back button green, users would get confused and may accidentally delete their account. Keeping it red makes it look dangerous. Damian said this was important to mention in the report as it is indicative of deep rationale.
- Add some captions to the FAQ video
- (My Idea) Future Work could implement lang files for different languages
- 
- Site works extremely well over all for Physical/Visual/Auditory/Cognitive Accessibility: 
	- Damian Evaluated Accessibility With:
		- Bobby Accessibility
		- WebAIM's WAVE Tool
	- Screen Readers:
		- JAWS
		- SimplyWeb2000
- Overall Review 9.8/10

Other suggestions from Damian:
- Get the site hosted and just use mock data once the project is over so we can
