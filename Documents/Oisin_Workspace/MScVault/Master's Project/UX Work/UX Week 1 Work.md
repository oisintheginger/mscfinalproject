## What did we do?
Over the course of the last few days, I have been working on mockups for the UX of our application so that we could have a visual explanation of our app.

While initially I intended to create rougher mockups and follow a ground-up approach to developing the system (i.e. start with wireframes and validate those with test users, and progress to medium fidelity prototype testing), constraints on time meant that we needed a visualization fast, if we were to meet our development deadline by week 6. 

To do this we looked at existings websites including but not limited to Zillow and Daft.ie (some of the largest listings sites in the US and Ireland respectively).  Other research sources included rentola.de, a popular German listings site, and rent.ie (although it's UI is somewhat dated). The reason to do this was simple: why reinvent the wheel? Our project is not aimed at a completely new concept, and a lot of the design mistakes have already been made by existing applications. In addition, it also helps us fulfill Jakob's UX law, whereby a website should be designed to be similar to existing websites to promote common understanding.

### Laws and Principles
There are a number of additional laws + principles have been taken into account in the design:
- Shallower Hierarchy to support simplicity
- Millers Chunking
- Law of Common Region + Proximity
- Universal Design Principles
  - Simple Hierarchy
  - Use familiar interactions and button designs
  - Simple color palette
  - Communicate to user the system state
- Color Theory based on the following document: https://putahatondotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/western-color-symbolism-chart.pdf
  - Dark Aquamarine: Water
  - Pale Teal: Sophistication
  - Turqoise:  Calm
