A non-linear iterative design process broken up into 5 stages.
- Empathize: Researching User Needs
- Define: State User's Needs and Problems
- Ideate: Challenge Assumptions and Create Ideas
- Prototype: Start to Create Solutions
- Test: Try Solutions out

## Empathize:
>[!quote] 
>The first stage of the design thinking process focuses on **user-centric research**. You want to gain an empathic understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. Consult experts to find out more about the area of concern and conduct observations to engage and empathize with your users. You may also want to immerse yourself in your users’ physical environment to gain a deeper, personal understanding of the issues involved—as well as their experiences and motivations. [Empathy](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/empathy "What is Empathy?") is crucial to problem solving and a human-centered [design process](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-process "What is Design Process?") as it allows design thinkers to set aside their own [assumptions](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/assumptions "What is Assumptions?") about the world and gain real insight into users and their needs.

## Define
>[!quote]
> In the Define stage, you will organize the information you have gathered during the Empathize stage. You’ll analyze your observations to define the core problems you and your team have identified up to this point. **[Defining the problem](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/defining-the-problem "What is Defining the Problem?") and problem statement must be done in a human-centered manner**.

## Ideate

> [!quote]
> During the third stage of the design thinking process, designers are ready to generate ideas. You’ve grown to understand your users and their needs in the Empathize stage, and you’ve analyzed your observations in the Define stage to create a user centric problem statement. With this solid background, you and your team members can start to **look at the problem from different perspectives and ideate innovative solutions to your problem statement**.

## Prototype

> [!quote]
> The design team will now produce a number of inexpensive, scaled down versions of the product (or specific features found within the product) to investigate the key solutions generated in the ideation phase. These prototypes can be shared and tested within the team itself, in other departments or on a small group of people outside the design team.

## Test

> [!quote] 
> Designers or evaluators rigorously test the complete product using the best solutions identified in the Prototype stage. This is the final stage of the five-stage model; however, in an iterative process such as design thinking, the results generated are often used to redefine one or more further problems. This increased level of understanding may help you investigate the conditions of use and how people think, behave and feel towards the product, and even lead you to loop back to a previous stage in the design thinking process. You can then proceed with further iterations and make alterations and refinements to rule out alternative solutions. **The ultimate goal is to get as deep an understanding of the product and its users as possible.**
