## Testing Flaws
The first participant generally gave lower scorings for difficulty, although this made it more obvious when serious design flaws were encountered. 

Due to latency in screen sharing over Teams during participant 2 + 4 testing, it was not clear enough to determine the time it took to acquire the screen targets. This made it impossible to perform analysis using timing. This can be addressed during MFP testing with in-person testing using a laptop.

An additional participant was scheduled for testing, however, last minute issues with screen sharing meant that the testing could not proceed
## Actions

> [!tip] Actions + Things to Do
> - Add 'Main Menu' label beside main menu button on desktop
> - Move the Favorite + Apply button to higher up on the details page
> - Include a label + change icon of save search icon
> - change color of landing page background image so that search bar stands out more
> - A/B testing for different icon associations + look up any existing work on accepted icon standards
> - Make complete later look more like a button

> [!danger] Discussion
> - Might be worth having floating elements for the favorite and apply buttons on
> - Add divider between application inputs and complete later button to help distinction
> - Testing generally went well, however MFP should ideally be conducted
