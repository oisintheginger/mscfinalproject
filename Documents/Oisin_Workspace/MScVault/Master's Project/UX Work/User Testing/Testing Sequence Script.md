1. Have you ever used a rental listings website before? (yes/no)
2. On a scale between 1-5, you rate your ability to use those websites, with 1 being total beginner and 5 being expert user.
3. Explanation: 
	- Today we will be doing some usability testing between two different UI interfaces. 
	- You will be asked to open up some PowerPoint slides, and share your screen with me. 
	- You will be asked to follow a sequence of instructions (i.e. select the home button). 
	- After each instruction you are required to hover your cursor over the screen element that is required to complete the action.
	- Once you have indicated the correct element, you will be asked to rate the difficulty of doing that action on a scale from 1-5 (1 being difficult - 5 being easy)
	- **DO NOT CLICK TO THE NEXT SLIDE UNTIL INSTRUCTED TO**
