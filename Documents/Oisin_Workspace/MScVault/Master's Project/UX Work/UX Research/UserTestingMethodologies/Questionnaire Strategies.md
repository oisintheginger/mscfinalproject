## Methods
### NASA TLX:
Example of a **Post-Task** questionnaire (i.e. question asked after each individual task in a sequence).
Assesses the subjective cognitive load to complete a task.

> [!danger] Downsides
> - Very complex questionnaire to ask after each task, will add a lot of time to the testing procedure
> - Interrupts the natural user flow
> - Requires explaining difference between effort and mental demand after each task.

> [!tip]
> - This would be better during MFP testing
> - Would be better to single out a particularly troublesome task such as 'favoriting' a property, which requires finding a small element.

### System Usability Scale:
Example of a **Post-Test** questionnaire, i.e. (asks users to answer questions after they have completed an entire task).

> [!danger] Downsides
> - This may not be suitable for LFP testing, as we are not able to leverage the natural interactivity of the web. This may break an experienced user's intution.
> -

> [!tip] 
> - Better for MFP with higher interactivity

### Single Ease Question
Another **Post-Task** Questionnaire.

> [!quote] SEQ
> "The “Single Ease Question” ([SEQ](https://measuringu.com/papers/Sauro_Dumas_CHI2009.pdf)) is a useful and simple version of this idea that has been experimentally validated and demonstrated as reliable, valid, and sensitive. The SEQ asks the user to rate the difficulty of the activity they just completed, from _Very Easy_ to _Very Difficult_ on a 7-point rating scale."

> [!tip]
> - Better for LFP
> - More fine-grained results

## Limitations with Methodologies

> [!danger]
> - All are subjective + self-reported
> - Can vary widely between individuals
> - Not great for small testing cohorts

> [!tip]
> - The task recordings will help us identify where users made mistakes, found difficult to find something. Adds level of objectivity to the mix.
> - We are only a small project, we don't have the time to spend on extensive user testing, we can wait till the MFP to do some of these.
