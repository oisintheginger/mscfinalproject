## Key Findings
The key findings from our survey are as follows:
### Most Useful Features
1. For tenants, the most useful rated features are, obviously, the features that allow the users to view property details. The key details for people are overview, images, amenities, contact details for the agent/landlord, and being able to save a property to look at later. ![[Pasted image 20231005164929.png]]
### Mobile and Desktop are King
Unsurprisingly, mobile and desktop are the most frequently used devices for using property listing services. ![[Pasted image 20231005165216.png]]

### Knowing Crime Rates Can Influence Decisions
Across all age groups, tenants agree that knowing the crime rate of an area would affect their decision to apply. ![[Pasted image 20231005170309.png]]

### Previous Knowledge is the primary strategy for safety assessment
For those that have assessed the safety of an area while looking for houses, previous knowledge about an area is the primary strategy. Prospective tenants without this knowledge would not necessarily have all the information to make an informed decision. People also rely on online search mechanisms to find information about an area. Our solution could improve this process by generating safety reports/ratings. ![[Pasted image 20231005170656.png]]

### Tenants would be interested in recommendation systems
Finally, tenants generally agree that they would be interested in a recommendation feature.

> [!tip] Reasons for Interest in Recommendation
> - more personalised
> - More focused results and not having to trawl through endless results
> - It would save me time
> - Easier for me to search
> - As a gay woman safety is important regarding the view of LGBTQ+ in a certain place
> - An email detailing properties based on a set of specific requirements would be very useful. The option to change frequency of email (as soon as available, daily, weekly, etc.)

> [!danger] Reasons against Recommendations
> - I'm able to think for myself
> - Unless there's 1000s of properties it's probably easier to just filter yourself IMO.
> - Anything that involve suggestions usually devolves into big property owners paying to be pushed to users which will even further unbalance the scales.

## Moving Forward and Key Takeaways
We have verified that our idea has some merit among users. While there are indeed existing property recommendation systems, there is indeed a gap in the market for safety assessment. 

Further as one of the reasons against suggestions explains, it is not often clear to the user how their recommendations are generated. As the respondent explains, often times, suggestions often are just additional fronts where property listers can pay to have their listings promoted and shown to more users. This could potentially be solved by having tags explaining why a property is being recommended to a user. 

> [!example]
> For example, a user has indicated that they attend nightclubs on a frequent basis. Therefore a tag 'nightclubs' should appear on the recommendations as a key feature. This would help make clear to the user why it was recommended to them, as it highlights in which aspect it may be desirable for the user.

This question about using tags to highlight relevant features within browsing results was put to a user from our LFP testing, and they agreed that they would find it useful.
