> [!example] My Activities
> This week I spent most of my time doing focusing on the user research aspects of our project, both from a UX and a general demographics point of view.
>- Zillow Analysis (~6 hours):
>	I performed an analysis of Zillow from a UX perspective. This was in part something we were asked to do by Brendan, but it is also something I briefly touched on before (I made some video recordings a couple weeks ago to get some inspiration for the design and LFP). Based on my critique (see [[Existing Apps & Zillow Analysis]]) I was able to "finalize" the design layout for the property details. I decided against following Zillow in their modal-based approach, and instead chose to design a separate page.
>- Finalize and Reformat Design Files (~12 hours):
>	I spent a large chunk of time over the weekend reformatting and standardizing the mockups. I realized that I had implemented them wrong, and so there were design inconsistencies between each of the different devices and views. By standardizing them, we have a better basis for starting development. In addition, it also helps us in the user testing department because we can have more consistency between different views along the steps.
>- Define Core Flows + Create LFP PowerPoint (~2 hours):
>	After finishing the mockups, I defined the core user flows and made a PowerPoint LFP (I'll add this to the repo now). This PowerPoint essentially is screenshots organized in the sequence in which they would appear as part of the core user flows  (i.e. landing page > browsing page > property details page).
>- Research Google Maps API Legal Research + Documentation(~3 hours): 
>	I did a small amount of research into what we can/can't do with Google Maps API. I read through the legal documents which detail how the API can be used and how its data may be stored. This proved crucial as there were significant restrictions on caching any data from it. This has significant impact in how our recommendation system works. I wrote a document 
>- Recommendation System Diagram (~2 hours):
>	Linked to the work regarding Google Maps API legal research was the recommendation system architecture diagram. The recommendation system was a very nebulous concept that didn't have any specifics, which made it hard to then plan tasks around it. It also made it hard for everyone to have a shared understanding of what it is doing and how it should generally be structured. I created a high-level architecture / flow diagram that clarified some details for the team. ![[RecommendationSystemDiagram.png]]
>- Began User Testing (~2 hours):
>	I also began the LFP User Testing. This involved sending out an email to Damian and another participant. I administered the test against 2 participants (my mam and that previously mentioned participant), each test roughly taking 30 mins to complete. I administered the test which involved the following procedure. I intend to complete testing with Damian and 3 more participants within the next week.
>	The initial plan was to do a comparison between Zillow LFP (using screenshots) and HME, but I realized this would not yield useful results, as Zillow was clearly more developed than our mockups.
>> [!note] Procedure
>> 1. Participant is sent a set of PowerPoint slides containing the core user flow + screenshots. 
>> 2. In a teams call, the participant is required to share their screen so that the slides + their cursor are visible.
>> 3. Both the screen and audio is recorded for data analysis
>> 4. Participant is then asked to complete a sequence of instructions (i.e. 'Enter a location into the search bar'), and is asked to rate the difficulty of the task once they have hovered their cursor over the correct element within the screenshot present in the slide. 
>> 5. The user cannot proceed to the next slide until they highlight the correct element.
>> 6. The procedure is conducted for each of the core user flows.
>- User Survey Data Analysis + Visualization in Tableau, and results report document (~12 hours):
>	I started working on tableau to visualize some of the data of our demographics and interest survey. The survey outcomes can be found in the  [[Survey Results]] document. I also have a small demo on YouTube:

>- Team Meetings (~2.5 hours):
>	Just regular standup meeting with the team throughout the week.

> [!note] Collaboration and Learning
> The data team needed more clarity on the Google Maps API, so I created that legal outline doc to explain to them. This helped them in their work. Stephen was able to continue his work in I also created the recommendation system diagram to keep the whole team on track with how it (should) work.

> [!tip] Reflections
> Overall this week was a lot more structured than the weeks prior. I had a lot more output than the previous 2 weeks. I think this is down to the fact that we have a plan in place, which means I am not as anxious about the trajectory of the project. I was able to get stuck in.
> I hope to start programming next week, and I believe I can get a lot of stuff done by week 6.
