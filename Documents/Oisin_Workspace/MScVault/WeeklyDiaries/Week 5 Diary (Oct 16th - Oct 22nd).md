> [!example] My Activities
> - Property Details Page (~12 hours)
> 	- Got a new map component working, which will eventually be hooked up so that the user can toggle features  on/off
> - Redesigned the Logo (~8 hours)
> 	- Logo needed to change, so I spent Saturday (14th October) redesigning the logo so that it was more legible.
> - Hooking up the filters with React Hook Form (~16 hours)
> 	- I spent Tuesday and Wednesday figuring out and tinkering with react hook forms for modifying the filters on the browsing + favorites page.
> 	- Took some time to get up to speed + had to re-think and refactor the filterFields component 
> - Hooking up Cognito with the Frontend (~ 8 hours):
> 	- I spent a few hours on Thursdays researching how to get started with AWS Cognito on the frontend. I didn't make much progress, so I decided to take a break until Friday.
> 	- On Friday, I managed to figure it out, and I got sign-in and sign-out working with the hosted UI, then did some experimenting with the auth library for manual sign-in /sign-out functionality. This will help future work in prompting the user to sign in when attempting to favorite a property while they are not logged in.
> - Daily Standups + Misc calls (~2.5)

> [!note] Collaboration and Learning
> Needed some help getting up to speed with AWS from Fenna. She was able to help me get started.

> [!tip] Reflections
> I hit a wall on Thursday trying to set up AWS cognito, so I decided to take a break. This helped me, as I was able to come back to the problem on Friday, with less effort and more clarity.
