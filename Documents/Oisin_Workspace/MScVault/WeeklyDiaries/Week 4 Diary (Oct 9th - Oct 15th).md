> - [x] Write LFP Report
> - [ ] Start Property Details Page

> [!example] My Activities
> - Shared Nav Layout (~ 8 hours):
> 	We needed a responsive, shared navigation menu that could be accessed from all areas of the website. It took me some time to get up an running because I had to relearn some MUI stuff. Overall it only took me a day to get up to speed.
> - Browsing Page (~ 16 hours):
> 	I spent Tuesday and most of Wednesday working on the browsing page. This is just about getting the rough layout of the page so that once we get started working on actual functionality, it should all slot in with minimal issues. I made a reusable page template component to make it easier to get started with the other pages. I also needed to research how to use the React Leaflet, because the documentation available online is incomplete.
> - Finishing LFP Testing (~5 hours):
> 	I finished the LFP testing with Damian (30 mins), rewatched all the recordings to transcribe them into an excel spreadsheet (~2 hours) and then wrote up a small report for the results with some analysis (~2 hours).
> - Daily Standups (~2.5 hours)
> - Meeting with Fenna + Charlotte (~1 hour):
> 	Fenna organized a call with Charlotte and I to discuss the functionality requirements and the necessary endpoints for communication between backend and frontend. Details will become clearer over time.
> - Call with Charlotte to discuss frontend work (~.5 hours):
> 	Because we are the frontend team, Charlotte and I have to work closely on what we do. We had a call to divvy up the work for the week. I took the browsing page and nav layout.
> - Making the breadcrumbs component reusable (expected: ~4 hours):
> 	We need to make the breadcrumb component within the page template reusable and receive props so that it changes based on the route the user took. This is mainly a concern for the property details page, which can be accessed from multiple different locations.
> - Finish making the active tag component (expected: ~2 hours):
> 	The active tags for filtering need to be able to be removed and adapt to whatever filters the user has active.

> [!note] Collaboration and Learning
> Myself and Charlotte are working hard to get the website layout up and running quickly. We are delegating tasks to one another and keeping each other updated on our work. 
> I asked Charlotte to read over my LFP testing report, and I delegated the task of creating the A/B testing for icons to her.
> I also helped 
> Fenna, Charlotte, and I are also communicating with each other to nail down functionality requirements for the backend endpoints.

> [!tip] Reflections
> This week went very well, everyone on the team is doing their jobs well. Myself and Charlotte are working well together. Personally, I am relieved that the browsing page went together as easily as it did, because it means that we can get the other pages up and running soon, and have more time to implement the functionality of the frontend.
