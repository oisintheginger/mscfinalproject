Hi guys, everyone is given their access to AWS now, this is a centralized cloud management tool that we will be using for the project. 

I strongly advice if you have something to try or just want to experiment creating resources, using functionalities. Do it on your own account creating one with AWS (it provides free trial).

Again EU West-1 will be the our region to work on as it is the nearest to us.

so whenever creating something do it in this region.

On the other hand I will be providing access key to add into development environment.
anything that is being developed in AWS will need this key to be connected with our resources.

Faqs:

Do I have to use AWS for something ?
** If you are unsure yet, dont do anything on AWS, in our daily meetings we will be talking about tasks on AWS and what each person has to do.

Do I have the right access?
** Not a good practice, but everyone has been given administrative access.

My password not working?
** Contact Nick :)
