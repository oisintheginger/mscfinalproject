Both approaches – using API Gateway with Lambda and using Java Spring Boot – have their own advantages and are suited for different scenarios. Let's compare the two based on various factors:

Scalability:

API Gateway + Lambda: This combination is inherently scalable. AWS automatically scales the number of Lambda function executions in response to the traffic received by the API Gateway.
Java Spring Boot: While Spring Boot doesn't automatically scale, you can deploy it on scalable platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Kubernetes to handle scalability.
Cost:

API Gateway + Lambda: You pay for the number of requests and the execution time of your functions. If your application has variable traffic, this might be cost-effective since you don't pay for idle time.
Java Spring Boot: Costs depend on where you host it. If you're using an EC2 instance, you pay for the uptime of the instance, regardless of traffic. However, using container services like ECS or EKS might optimize costs based on usage.
Development & Deployment Speed:

API Gateway + Lambda: Faster deployment since you only deploy functions and not an entire application. However, the development might be slightly slower due to the serverless paradigm's nuances.
Java Spring Boot: Familiar development model for many developers. Deployment might take longer, especially if you're containerizing the application.
Complexity:

API Gateway + Lambda: Each function is an independent unit, which can lead to easier debugging and isolation. However, managing many functions can become complex.
Java Spring Boot: Offers a monolithic or microservices approach. While monoliths are easier to develop and debug, microservices offer better scalability and isolation but come with added complexity.
State Management:

API Gateway + Lambda: Stateless by nature. If you need to maintain a state, you'd have to use external services like Redis or databases.
Java Spring Boot: Can maintain state, but for scalability, it's often recommended to keep it stateless.
Integration with Frontend (React):

Both approaches can be integrated seamlessly with a React frontend using AJAX calls or libraries like Axios.
Cold Starts:

API Gateway + Lambda: Lambda functions can experience cold starts, especially if using VPC. This can introduce latency in the application.
Java Spring Boot: No cold starts as the application is always running, but you pay for the uptime.
