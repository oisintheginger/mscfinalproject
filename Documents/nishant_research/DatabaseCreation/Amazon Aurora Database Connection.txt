Amazon Aurora Database Connection Manual

Connecting Amazon Aurora to a Database Client:
Amazon RDS Console:

Log in to the Amazon RDS Console.
Navigate to the "Databases" section and select your Aurora instance.
Endpoint & Port:

Under the "Connectivity & security" tab, note down the "Endpoint" and "Port". The endpoint is the hostname you'll use to connect to Aurora, and the port is typically 3306 for MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL.
Database Credentials:

Ensure you have the username and password you set up for the Aurora instance.
Database Client:

Open your chosen database client.
Create a new connection/profile.
Enter the Aurora endpoint as the hostname/server.
Enter the port number.
Provide the username and password.
Test the connection and save it if successful.
Security Groups:

If you're unable to connect, ensure that the security group associated with your Aurora instance allows inbound traffic on the appropriate port from your IP address or CIDR block.
Update the security group rules if necessary.
SSL:

Amazon Aurora supports SSL connections. If your client supports it, consider using SSL for enhanced security. Download the necessary RDS SSL root certificates from the AWS documentation.
