Zillow Approach. 

Content-Based Scoring: 

  

For each home (or “listing”), a score is computed based on the user's preference profile and the home's attributes. 

The main aim is to predict a user’s click probability for each home. This score would be a relevance score, which is essentially a measure of how likely a user is to click on a particular listing based on their past interactions and preferences. 

Content-based models can address the cold-start problem, i.e., for newly listed homes that haven’t been interacted with by many users. 

Diversification Algorithm: 

  

After generating scores using the content-based model, Zillow applies a diversification algorithm to improve the diversity of the recommendations. 

The diversification algorithm re-sorts the list of homes based on a submodular objective function that balances both relevance and diversity. 

The algorithm tries to ensure that the recommended homes are not just relevant but also diverse in terms of property type, price, size, etc. This is important to give users a variety of options and help them explore the market better. 

Category-Based Scoring: 

  

Zillow partitions homes into categories. To achieve this categorization, they consider home attributes like price, square footage, and house type and cluster the listings. 

Two types of user preferences for these categories are computed: global user category preference (based on overall click-through rates) and personalized category preference (adjusted for each user based on their past click history). 

The combination of these preferences with the home's category helps in further refining the score. 

User Feedback & Historical Data: 

Zillow considers users’ click history to understand their preferences. This feedback is crucial for refining scores. For instance, a home that matches the user's previously clicked or liked homes would get a higher score. 

Collaboration with External Information: 

Large platforms like Zillow use collaborative filtering techniques, where scores are determined based on patterns of likes or interactions across multiple users.
