Amazon Aurora Database Design Manual

1. Requirement Analysis
You need to understand the  requirements. What is the purpose of the database? What kind of data will it store? Who will use it?
Identify Entities: Identify the main objects or concepts in the system. For example, for an e-commerce platform, entities might include Users, Products, Orders, etc.
2. Define Relationships
Identify Relationships: Determine how the entities relate to each other. For example, a User can place multiple Orders, but each Order is placed by one User.
Cardinality: Determine the cardinality of the relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
3. Normalization
Remove Redundancies: Ensure that each piece of data is stored in only one place.
Organize Data: Organize the data into tables in a way that reduces redundancy and improves data integrity.
Decompose Tables: If necessary, break down larger tables into smaller ones to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.
4. Define Tables and Columns
Create Tables: For each entity and relationship, create a table.
Define Columns: For each attribute of an entity or relationship, define a column in the respective table.
Set Data Types: For each column, set an appropriate data type (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE).
5. Set Primary and Foreign Keys
Primary Keys: Every table should have a primary key, which uniquely identifies each record in the table.
Foreign Keys: Use foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
6. Indexing
Identify Columns: Identify columns that will be frequently searched or used in WHERE clauses.
Create Indexes: Create indexes on these columns to speed up query performance.
7. Implement Constraints
Data Integrity: Use constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, etc., to ensure data integrity.
Referential Integrity: Use foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity between tables.
8. Design Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers (if necessary)
Views: Create views for commonly accessed data or complex queries.
Stored Procedures: Use stored procedures for complex business logic.
Triggers: Implement triggers for automated actions in response to specific changes in the database.
9. Review and Refinement
Feedback: Get feedback from stakeholders, developers, and database administrators.
Refinement: Make necessary changes based on feedback.
10. Implementation in Amazon Aurora
Set Up Amazon Aurora: Create an Amazon Aurora instance in the AWS Management Console.
Connect to Aurora: Use a database client or AWS's RDS console to connect to your Aurora instance.
Execute SQL Scripts: Run your SQL scripts to create tables, relationships, indexes, etc., in Aurora.
11. Testing
Populate with Sample Data: Insert some sample data into your tables.
Run Test Queries: Execute some test queries to ensure everything is working as expected.
Performance Tuning: If necessary, make adjustments to improve performance.
12. Documentation
Document Schema: Create a document detailing your database schema, including tables, relationships, indexes, etc.
ER Diagram: Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to visually represent the structure of your database.
13. Maintenance
Regular Backups: Set up regular backups for your Aurora database.
Monitor Performance: Use AWS's monitoring tools to keep an eye on the performance of your Aurora instance.
Updates and Changes: As business requirements change, update your database schema accordingly.
