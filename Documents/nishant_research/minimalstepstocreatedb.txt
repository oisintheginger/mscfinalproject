Steps to Create the Database 

Initial Setup: We started by navigating to the Amazon RDS console and initiated the database creation process. 

Configuration: Opting for the 'Standard Create' method, we chose MySQL as our engine type and selected the free tier template. 

Instance Details: We defined our database with the identifier myhmedb and set up our master username and password. Ensuring cost-efficiency, we chose the "Burstable classes (includes t2)" under the "DB instance size" section.
