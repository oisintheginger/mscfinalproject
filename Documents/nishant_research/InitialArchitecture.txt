Initial Architecture: 

The original system was designed with the following workflow: 

  

User Interaction: Users would interact directly with the Amplify frontend. 

Amplify to API: The Amplify platform would relay user requests to an API endpoint. 

API to Lambda: The API would trigger a Lambda function to handle specific database operations. 

Lambda Interaction with DB: This function would communicate with the database to execute CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 

Data Storage in S3: Processed or retrieved data would be stored in an S3 bucket. 

S3 to SageMaker: Data in S3 would then be used by SageMaker for machine learning or analytics tasks.
