    more detailed explanation of cognito authentication and authorisation + demo

After discussion with oisin, nishant and char, the following questions need to be answered:
	- How to use the generated login/register stuff?
		○ Specify callback url
		○ The generated UI can be integrated into your app or it will open a specific
		○ Once the person logs in you go to the specified callback url
		○ Cognito adds the JWT to the url so you can retrieve it and save it to local storage
		○ Use that in all your subsequent calls to the api gateway to authorise
	- How customisable is the login/register pages
		○ You can completely customise the login page however you want through the UI customisation tab
		○ Or you can do everything through the aws cognito sdk, and interact with the api endpoints directly
	- How to use user pool id (?) in our own db for extra functionality (personal qs, fave properties and saved searches)?
		○ We can use the id_token or cognito-username/email to match the data

notes:
	- You can use your own website domain for amazon cognito (more complicated with certificates and such)
	Isnt needed if don’t use the generated UI
