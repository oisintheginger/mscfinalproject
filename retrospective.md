# Weekly Project Retrospective

## Week 2: 25/09/2023

### Team Members:
1. Nishant
2. Sean
3. Stephen
4. Charlotte
5. Fenna
6. Oisin


### What Went Well:
- Nishant: Putting together all the elements from different team members to make the presentation.
- Sean:  In the initial two weeks, we commenced the process of formulating a solid plan. We created a Gantt chart to map out our activities and distributed tasks among team members. Collaborative meetings were scheduled to address different problems team members had where we shared our insights on potential approaches to tackle them.
- Stephen: project plan documentations.
- Charlotte: Editing the documentation, researching various react packages.
- Fenna: I thought we were quite efficient, and got a lot of work done in a small amount of time. Especially with the project plan and presentation. 
- Oisin: team presentation.

### What Could Be Improved:
- Nishant: Interoperability between teams should be improved, everyone should be aware of what all other team mates are doing.
- Sean: Our github work flow
- Stephen: Time management could be improved.
- Charlotte: Communication between team members.
- Fenna: clearer delegation of common tasks such as submission. 
- Oisin: collaboration


### Action Items for Next Week:
- Nishant: Researching and starting to implement different components of the applications, such as database, front end, and learn how to deploy them in AWS, utilising the free tier.
- Sean: Researching how the rapid API works, plan to extract and clean data using API in jupyter notebooks.
- Stephen: NA 
- Charlotte: NA
- Fenna: NA
- Oisin: NA


### Additional Comments:
- Nishant: NA
- Sean: NA
- Stephen: Setting up github was a challenge but the team helped me.
- Charlotte: It was difficult to get up and running but we have made good progress and are starting to mesh together as a team.
- Fenna: I’m proud of us for hitting the ground running the first 2 weeks.
- Oisin: NA

## Week 3: 02/10/2023

### Team Members:
1. Nishant
2. Sean
3. Stephen
4. Charlotte
5. Fenna
6. Oisin

### What Went Well:
- Nishant: We had already a lot to do, with the gant chart, and all the activities listed in the project plan. Everyone from the team was busy doing their tasks, and we were exchanging ideas and showing the results to the team.
- Sean: Successfully collected all the data through the Rapid API. Familiarised myself more with the Github collaborative workflow. Did some database schema planning but more is needed.
- Stephen: Completed EDA for the crime records dataset.
- Charlotte: Finished refreshing myself on react and started with page layouts.
- Fenna: Because of the project plan everybody’s tasks were clear and we all just kept working. 
- Oisin: Everyone kinda just did their thing, no real barriers to work.



### What Could Be Improved:
- Nishant: Time management could be improved. As a lot of tasks are awaiting to be completed, there is a gap in research and implementation to be covered.
- Sean: Managing data requests under the 13,000 limit for cost-saving presented challenges. While I successfully stayed within this threshold, I identified areas for efficiency improvement. Specifically, I encountered null values in certain keys and refined my code to prevent loop interruptions. Additionally, I occasionally had to rerun a for loop due to accidental dataset deletions or post-loop realisations about extracting additional information we initially overlooked.
- Stephen: Time spent researching material to complete tasks.
Charlotte: Time management has not been great this week.
- Fenna: Collaboration especially between the software and data science side. I kinda get what’s going on, but I feel like I only hear about issues after the fact. 
- Oisin: NA


### Action Items for Next Week:
- Nishant: Try researching the minimum, and start on implementation.
- Sean: Clean the data and start putting together a schema plan, come up with a solid way of organising the data into different tables in the database. I also will need to work with the Google API to extract neighbourhood information for each property and create a new crime dataset that displays crime information by region. Finally I will research other datasets available that we can bring into the project as well as looking for more crime information available.
Stephen: Gathering the businesses dataset around the properties
- Charlotte: Continuing with front end development.
- Fenna: Keep each other more up to date with current issues and wins, while working ahead for the interim report and presentation. 
- Oisin: just keep ploughing ahead.


### Additional Comments:
- Nishant:
- Sean:
- Stephen: It was a real challenge getting my Google API up and running, even while doing all the steps they recommended on their website.
- Charlotte: I hate Google API - it was not as easy to set up as I expected, thankfully Stephen helped me.
- Fenna: N/A
- Oisin:
